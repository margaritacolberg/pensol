  // for example, if x = 7.5 and l = 3, then x is 2.5 boxes;
  // std::floor rounds the number 2.5 to 2, since we want to
  // count full boxes traversed;
  // we then multiply 2 by l to get 6, which is the total
  // distance of 2 boxes traversed completely;
  // so overall, the bead whose x-coordinate at 7.5
  // is located at x = 7.5 - 6 = 1.5

  // mindist proceeds in the same way as minpos, except here,
  // instead of the result being normalized between 0 and l,
  // it is now between -l/2 and l/2;
  // rounding is done up or down to determine the smallest
  // distance between two beads
